# Day 1 — Ruby on Rails Internship @ Dayspring Technology 🚀

This repository contains my daily learning, tasks, documentation, and submissions throughout my 3-month Ruby on Rails internship.

Day 1 was all about understanding **what Ruby is**, **what Rails is**, and how they are related. I also set up my entire development environment and ran my very first Ruby program.

## Understanding Ruby and Rails

I learned that:

- **Ruby** is a programming language.
- **Rails** is a web framework built using Ruby.
- Rails applications are written in Ruby, but Ruby itself can run independently without Rails.

This cleared a major confusion for me: Rails is not the language — Ruby is.

## Ruby Version Managers (RVM)

I got introduced to the concept of **Ruby Version Managers** like RVM.

### Why this is needed?

Because different projects can use different Ruby versions. RVM helps switch between them easily without breaking anything.

## Installing the Essentials

I installed:

- Ruby
- Rails
- RubyGems

Then I verified the installation using:

```bash
ruby -v
rails -v
gem -v
